# Github Vocab

Repository - A project containing all of your coding files and folders.

Pull - A way to grab files from github and put them on your local machine.

Git Add - Tells git to track (in other words pre-SAVE) a new file that you created or pre-save an existing file that you edited. Can quickly do this by doing "git add ." in the terminal. Using the period pre-saves all the files that you either created or edited. If you want to do an individual file just put the individual file name after the "add".

Git Commit - This actually saves the file on git and saves the changes made. It will save these changes and leave a history of all saves, or commits. Think of commit as github's way of saying save. Do this by typing "git commit -m "Type Title of change" -m "Type optional description of change" ". Now this saves the files only locally.


## Subheader - Hidden Files

When accesing the repository you pulled on your local machine or device, there is hidden folders that show your changes throughout. It ends with a ".git" and will track all the saves you made. To see these hidden folders just list all hidden directorys by typing "ls -la" in the terminal. Make sure you are using bash shell as well.
